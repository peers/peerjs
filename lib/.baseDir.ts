// grunt-ts creates this file to help TypeScript find the compilation root of your project.  If you wish to get to stop creating it, specify a `rootDir` setting in the tsconfig.json.  See https://github.com/TypeStrong/grunt-ts#rootdir for details.  Note that `rootDir` goes under `options`, and is case-sensitive.  This message was revised in grunt-ts v6.  Note that `rootDir` requires TypeScript 1.5  or higher.
